Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-08-05 23:27:35.
Progress(16) at 2025-08-05 23:27:38: 7,087 states generated (7,087 s/min), 3,239 distinct states found (3,239 ds/min), 1,260 states left on queue.
Progress(46) at 2025-08-05 23:28:38: 559,226 states generated (552,139 s/min), 222,145 distinct states found (218,906 ds/min), 16,590 states left on queue.
Progress(88) at 2025-08-05 23:29:01: 1,356,756 states generated, 526,798 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking temporal properties for the complete state space with 526798 total distinct states at (2025-08-05 23:29:01)
Finished checking temporal properties in 03h 55min at 2025-08-06 03:24:50
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.4E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 4.4E-9
1356756 states generated, 526798 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 88.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 9 and the 95th percentile is 2).
Finished in 03h 57min at (2025-08-06 03:24:52)
