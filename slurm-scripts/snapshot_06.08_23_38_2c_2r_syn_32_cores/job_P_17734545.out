Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-08-05 23:27:35.
Progress(22) at 2025-08-05 23:27:39: 24,049 states generated (24,049 s/min), 9,974 distinct states found (9,974 ds/min), 2,257 states left on queue.

Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.4E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 4.2E-8
1356756 states generated, 526798 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 88.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 9 and the 95th percentile is 2).
Finished in 04min 34s at (2025-08-05 23:32:06)
