Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-08-05 23:27:36.
Progress(24) at 2025-08-05 23:27:39: 47,558 states generated (47,558 s/min), 19,454 distinct states found (19,454 ds/min), 3,032 states left on queue.
Progress(88) at 2025-08-05 23:28:14: 1,356,756 states generated, 526,798 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking 3 branches of temporal properties for the complete state space with 1580394 total distinct states at (2025-08-05 23:28:14)
Finished checking temporal properties in 02min 59s at 2025-08-05 23:31:14
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.4E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 2.8E-8
1356756 states generated, 526798 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 88.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 8 and the 95th percentile is 2).
Finished in 03min 44s at (2025-08-05 23:31:16)
