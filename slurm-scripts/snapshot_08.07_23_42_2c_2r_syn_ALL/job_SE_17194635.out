Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-07-08 23:24:58.
Progress(31) at 2025-07-08 23:25:01: 116,920 states generated (116,920 s/min), 47,747 distinct states found (47,747 ds/min), 5,886 states left on queue.
Progress(88) at 2025-07-08 23:25:19: 1,356,756 states generated, 526,798 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking temporal properties for the complete state space with 526798 total distinct states at (2025-07-08 23:25:19)
Finished checking temporal properties in 05min 31s at 2025-07-08 23:30:51
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.4E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 8.1E-9
1356756 states generated, 526798 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 88.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 9 and the 95th percentile is 2).
Finished in 05min 54s at (2025-07-08 23:30:52)
