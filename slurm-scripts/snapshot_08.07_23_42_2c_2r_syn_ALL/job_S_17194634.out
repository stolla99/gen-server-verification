Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-07-08 23:20:33.
Progress(35) at 2025-07-08 23:20:37: 181,079 states generated (181,079 s/min), 74,435 distinct states found (74,435 ds/min), 9,474 states left on queue.
Progress(88) at 2025-07-08 23:20:56: 1,356,756 states generated, 526,798 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking 3 branches of temporal properties for the complete state space with 1580394 total distinct states at (2025-07-08 23:20:56)
Finished checking temporal properties in 03min 10s at 2025-07-08 23:24:06
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.4E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 1.1E-7
1356756 states generated, 526798 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 88.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 9 and the 95th percentile is 2).
Finished in 03min 34s at (2025-07-08 23:24:07)
