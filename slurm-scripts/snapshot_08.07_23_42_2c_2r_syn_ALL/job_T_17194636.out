Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-07-08 23:32:36.
Progress(35) at 2025-07-08 23:32:39: 200,305 states generated (200,305 s/min), 81,942 distinct states found (81,942 ds/min), 10,163 states left on queue.
Progress(88) at 2025-07-08 23:32:52: 1,356,756 states generated, 526,798 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking temporal properties for the complete state space with 526798 total distinct states at (2025-07-08 23:32:52)
Finished checking temporal properties in 03min 57s at 2025-07-08 23:36:50
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.4E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 4.8E-8
1356756 states generated, 526798 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 88.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 8 and the 95th percentile is 2).
Finished in 04min 15s at (2025-07-08 23:36:50)
