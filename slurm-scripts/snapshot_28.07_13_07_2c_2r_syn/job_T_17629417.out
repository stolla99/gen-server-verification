Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-07-28 01:44:22.
Progress(20) at 2025-07-28 01:44:26: 22,953 states generated (22,953 s/min), 9,639 distinct states found (9,639 ds/min), 2,437 states left on queue.
Progress(88) at 2025-07-28 01:45:20: 1,356,756 states generated, 526,798 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking temporal properties for the complete state space with 526798 total distinct states at (2025-07-28 01:45:20)
Finished checking temporal properties in 03min 02s at 2025-07-28 01:48:22
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.4E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 1.3E-8
1356756 states generated, 526798 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 88.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 8 and the 95th percentile is 2).
Finished in 04min 24s at (2025-07-28 01:48:42)
