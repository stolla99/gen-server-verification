Implied-temporal checking--satisfiability problem has 2 branches.
Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-08-06 23:41:02.
Progress(54) at 2025-08-06 23:41:03: 1,511 states generated, 914 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking 2 branches of temporal properties for the complete state space with 1828 total distinct states at (2025-08-06 23:41:03)
Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2025-08-06 23:41:04
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 3.0E-14
1511 states generated, 914 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 54.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 5 and the 95th percentile is 2).
Finished in 04s at (2025-08-06 23:41:04)
